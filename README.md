9. The only built in functions that are designed to return a value is the prompt function. The prompt method prompts the user for input. 
10. The first answer I chose was correct, but the next one was not. The parameter variable that dosen't receive a outside variable returns as undefined, and that is what registers in the console. Therefore, I need to do homework, chores, and more homework... So busy! and I need to do chores, homework, and undefined... So busy! are the correct answers.

5. It is necessary to put the (); behind the function name so the code executes properly and the computer recognizes that it is indeed a function. My original answer did not have (); behind the function name, therefore, it would not execute properly. 
7. I believe I am correct.
9. The only valid data types in Javascript is number, symbol, string, null, boolean, object, and undefined. Those are the only valid data types in Javascript.
